# AI Usage

- Used ChatGPT for refactoring a hefty/clunky function, overall improving code quality
  - I did this by giving ChatGPT some context into the core application that I'm building, and then pointing it to my specific function that I want to refactor. I also mentioned some core concepts learned in CS2103T such as maintaining the same level of abstraction throughout the same function.
- Used GitHub Copilot for automatic code completions, as well as generating JavaDoc comments
